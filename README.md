# Finlatics Data Science & Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains my project submissions and analyses completed during the Finlatics Machine Learning Program. The projects focus on applying core Machine Learning techniques to real-world datasets using Python and popular machine learning libraries.

## ðŸ“‚ Projects Included

1. **Sales Prediction Dataset**  
   Analysis of advertising expenditures on TV, Radio, and Newspaper to predict product sales using Linear Regression. Explored relationships through correlation, visualized regression fits, and performed model evaluation.

2. **Wine Quality Prediction**  
   Performed exploratory data analysis on the Red Wine Quality dataset. Built ML models to predict wine quality based on physicochemical properties, comparing model performances.

3. **Facebook Marketplace Dataset**  
   Conducted analysis on Facebook Live Sellers dataset, explored relationships between engagement metrics, and applied K-Means clustering to segment post types based on reactions, comments, and shares.
